## Features

### 1. **Shuffle alphabets for Name**
A name field have to fill with shuffling alphabets, looks easy but not (actually feel the pain only, when you try to type your whole name)

### 2. **Phone Number feild that Increment by 1**
It's actually a wrist pain

### 3. **A chatbox **
which should a Helpful Assistant ðŸ¤¡ but it's a Customer Disservice

### 4. **Moving ball captcha** 
in which is hard to catch ball to proceed , but here is  catch! the captcha can submit on click the button at middle too
basically reminds user about "Fishing far and wide while the fish is in your own pond."

### 5. **Enhance UX button**
named enhance ux but actually it ruins it by flooding tons of stickers, overly dramatically misleads the user

### 6. **feedback mouth**
The mouth opening to reveal an input field is unexpected and may confuse users unfamiliar with the design.

### 7. **Binary Button for Age**
to reminds the user about the maths class he bunked:)

### 8. **Country Flag Drawing**
bored of dropdown let's draw

### 9. **Celestial DOB Picker**
Like a slot machine for your birthdate, look nerdy but lil frustrating at same time

in last when he clicked submit, he realize there is no need to feel all this pain to fill form :)
