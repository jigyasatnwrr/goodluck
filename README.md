## Features

### 1. **Shuffle Box Name**
A box that randomly shuffles the name inside it. Every time you click, the name changes position and can be difficult to track.

### 2. **Phone Number Increment**
A phone number that automatically increments by one each time you click on it. It's frustrating as it continues to increase uncontrollably.

### 3. **Binary Button Age**
A button that toggles between "0" and "1" each time you press it. It simulates binary counting and can make you lose track of time.

### 4. **Country Flag Drawing**
Each time you click the button, a random country flag is drawn. Flags change unexpectedly, adding an element of surprise and confusion.

### 5. **Catify Button**
When clicked, this button fills the screen with an overwhelming number of cat images. At first fun, but soon frustrating as the cats flood the screen.
